1,Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
 ans ;Classes are aggregates if they contain other classes as components, represented by aggregation in the UML diagram.

2,If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
 ans ;When overriding the equals() method, if the object passed as a parameter (obj) is not an instance of the target class (Media or Track), the method will return false.

3.What class should implement the Comparable interface?
 ans ;The Media class (or its subclasses, like DVD, if specific ordering is needed) should implement the Comparable interface since it represents the items to be ordered.

4.How should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the desired ordering?
 ans ;Implement the compareTo() method based on the attributes to reflect the ordering rules. 

5.Can we have two ordering rules (e.g., by title then cost, and by cost then title) using Comparable?
 ans ;No, the Comparable interface allows only one natural ordering since the compareTo() method can only define a single comparison rule.

6.How to allow DVDs to have a different ordering rule (by title, then decreasing length, then cost)?
 ans ;Override compareTo() in the DVD subclass.
